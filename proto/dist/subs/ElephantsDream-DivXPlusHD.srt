1
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:18,243
At the left we can see...
We can see...

2
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:20,375
At the right we can see the...

3
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,292
...the head-snarlers

4
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:24,662
Everything is safe.
Perfectly safe.

5
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,328
Emo?

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,290
Watch out!

7
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,790
Are you hurt?

8
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,247
I don't think so.
You?

9
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,283
I'm Ok.

10
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:01,411
Get up.
Emo, it's not safe here.

11
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,458
Let's go.

12
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,413
What's next?

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,446
You'll see!

14
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:14,247
(howling wind)

15
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,324
Emo.
This way.

16
00:01:34,542 --> 00:01:35,786
Follow me!

17
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,243
(buzzing wires and chattery conversations)

18
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:12,791
Hurry Emo!

19
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,036
(louder telephone voices)

20
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,745
(phone ringing)

21
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,247
You're not paying attention!

22
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:54,368
I just want to answer the...
...phone.

23
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:58,290
Emo, look,
I mean listen.

24
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,326
You have to learn to listen.

25
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,283
This is not some game.

26
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:09,665
You, i mean we,
we could easily die out here.

27
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:14,279
Listen,
listen to the sounds of the machine.

28
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,330
Listen to your breathing.

29
00:03:27,292 --> 00:03:29,247
(Buzzing wires)

30
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:36,747
(laughing)

31
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,663
(oriental dance music)

32
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,288
Well, don't you ever get tired of this?

33
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:31,242
Tired?!?

34
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:34,824
Emo, the machine is like clockwork.

35
00:04:35,417 --> 00:04:37,408
One move out of place...

36
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,455
...and you're ground to a pulp.

37
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,375
But isn't it -

38
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:46,369
Pulp, Emo!
Is that what you want, pulp?

39
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,330
Emo, your goal in life...

40
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,289
...pulp?

41
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:10,745
(loud metal sounds)

42
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,372
Emo, close your eyes.

43
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,372
Why?
- Now!

44
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,448
Ok.

45
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,034
Good.

46
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,450
What do you see at your left side, Emo?

47
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:06,247
Nothing.
- Really?

48
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,453
No, nothing at all.

49
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:12,333
And at your right,
what do you see at your right side, Emo?

50
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,451
The same Proog, exactly the same...

51
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,448
...nothing!
- Great.

52
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,455
(sound of camera flash)

53
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:32,038
(engine drone)

54
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,077
Listen Proog! Do you hear that!
(amusement park music)

55
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,248
Can we go here?

56
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,248
There?
It isn't safe, Emo.

57
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,368
But...
- Trust me, it's not.

58
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,500
Maybe I could...

59
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,325
No.

60
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,290
NO!

61
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,415
Any further questions, Emo?

62
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,447
No.

63
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:10,447
Emo?

64
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,417
Emo, why...

65
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:14,417
Emo...

66
00:07:14,417 --> 00:07:18,363
...why can't you see
the beauty of this place?

67
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,407
The way it works.

68
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,292
How perfect it is.

69
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:27,325
No, Proog, I don't see.

70
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:30,332
I don't see because there's nothing there.

71
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:35,327
And why should I trust my
life to something that isn't there?

72
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,289
Well can you tell me that?

73
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:39,289
Answer me!

74
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:44,363
Proog...

75
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,375
...you're a sick man!

76
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,282
Stay away from me!

77
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:55,249
No! Emo! It's a trap!

78
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,333
Hah, it's a trap.

79
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,409
At the left side you can see
the hanging gardens of Babylon!

80
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,324
How's that for a trap?

81
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:07,289
No, Emo.

82
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,456
At the right side you can see...
...well guess what...

83
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,034
...the colossus of Rhodes!

84
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,458
No!

85
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:22,288
The colossus of Rhodes
and it is here just for you Proog.

86
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,333
It is there...

87
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,414
I'm telling you,
Emo...

88
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,243
...it is.

89
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:07,745
(howling wind)
