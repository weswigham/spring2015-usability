1
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,500
This blade has a dark past.

2
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
It has shed much innocent blood.

3
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,450
You're a fool for traveling alone,
so completely unprepared.

4
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,800
You're lucky your blood's still flowing.

5
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,300
Thank you.

6
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,000
So...

7
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,800
What brings you to
the land of the gatekeepers?

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm searching for someone.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,200
Someone very dear?
A kindred spirit?

10
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
A dragon.

11
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,750
A dangerous quest for a lone hunter.

12
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,870
I've been alone for
as long as I can remember.

13
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,500
We're almost done. Shhh...

14
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,500
Hey, sit still.

15
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,250
Good night, Scales.

16
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,850
Get him, Scales! Come on!

17
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,250
Scales?

18
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Yeah! Come on!

19
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,000
Scales!

20
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,500
I have failed.

21
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,500
You've only failed to see...

22
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,500
These are dragon lands, Sintel.

23
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,000
You are closer than you know.

24
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,500
Scales!

25
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Scales?

26
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,800
Scales...
