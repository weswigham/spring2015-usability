## SRS First release
We are happy to say, that our first draft of our SRS is complete. It contains multiple personas and scenarios,
a variety of charts, and a collection of wireframes. The team was able to meet and better define what the interface might look like,
as well as gather interviews from multiple usergroups. Below, we have captured the images we used to start the discussion of wireframes.

Some elements, such as the toast notifications and colors, can be better seen here, than their wireframe counterparts.
