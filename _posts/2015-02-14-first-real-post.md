## Project Decided!
Our project will be the Mobile Movie Closed Captioning App.  

While we have yet to formalize some of the initial concerns, some things we
are thinking about include:

* Getting Sponsors / Testers / Formal Requirements
* Becoming familiar with Android Development
* Looking at the first set of Deliverables
* Formalizing the personas made in class
* Nailing down when the team can meet outside of class

Things that we have yet to discuss, but I'd personally like to put on the table
include:

* Deciding on a Process Model
* Building Paper Prototypes

While we have had no formal team meeting yet, my hope is that we will have an
initial meeting and start discussing what questions we will ask for the
requirements elicitation.
