title: User Testing in a Theater Near You!
author: Jesse Jurman

Over the week we have discussed different icons, specifically the play/ pause that is commonplace in video players. We also discussed how we might do user testing in a (possibly paper) prototype session. The informal document covers certain tasks we would ask the user to take, as well as the states the phone would enter.   

One thing mentioned in the meeting was the removal of the capture button, in favor of automatically determining when the camera was pointed at a display, and merely putting a timer up then, telling the user not to move their phone from the screen... In early prototypes, this may be hacked together by checking the accelerometer.
