Jesse asked me to find everyone a tutorial on how to use Apache Cordova - well, here's an 
[AngularJSTodo Example.](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/AngularJS-TODO-Sample-for-b651512a/)
You'll note that a Cordova application is just an html/js single page app with some additional
APIs provided by Cordova. If you open the solution in the example, and select config.xml, you'll
find that visual studio has an integrated editor for installing Cordova plugins to get more
hardware APIs.

Anyways, we don't have to use angular - there's the same example project using 
[WinJS](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/WinJS-TODO-Sample-for-17295485) and 
[BackboneJS](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/BackboneJS-TODO-Sample-for-615ac9f0) as other examples.
Since we're focusing on Android development, we should choose a framework with a good 
[material design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) integration
library. I, for one, know about [angular-material](https://material.angularjs.org/#/) for angular and
[material-ui](http://material-ui.com/#/) for react/jsx. Which frameworks, specifically, we'd
like to use is up for discussion, but I think's it's safe to say that we all have some experience
with web development, right?
