## Progress?
Our team has not quite had a formal meeting yet, due to a combination of work-load and death-defying weather.  
We did however, in fleeting moments of class, get a chance to discuss some of the 
possible testers and patterns we could use in our app.  Links to these patterns have been recorded down in our 
google document.  

We also discussed some of the questions we might ask in our interviews. We have decided that the formalization of these will
require a formal meeting.  

Also noted, but not formally mentioned, is the upcomming SRS, which we'll be evaluating as time progresses (hopefully as soon as this week).
